# What 
This is a framework built on top of https://github.com/DockerByTheGo/blaze-minimal-lib so that there are some built in solutions for common problems from the core team

# Why a seperate project
Well the original project is supposed to be a ver barebones library and by having a seperate repo we ensure separations of concerns and also work is much more easier like that since the projects can be versioned seperately. that way the original repo isnt buckled with things not related to the core idea
